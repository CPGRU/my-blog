## Ingredients
- all-purpose flour | 1 cup
- sugar | 2 teaspoons
- baking powder | 2 teaspoons
- salt | 1 teaspoon
- milk | 1 cup
- vegetable oil | 2 tablespoons
- egg | 1 piece, beaten

## Method
> Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the center, and pour in milk, oil, and egg. Mix until smooth.
> Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.
> Serve hot and enjoy!
